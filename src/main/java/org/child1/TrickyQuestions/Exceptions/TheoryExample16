Scenario 4️⃣: Checked exception in constructor

If constructor throws exception:

Object creation fails

Reference never assigned


If constructor throws exception:

Memory is allocated
Constructor starts
Exception occurs
Constructor NEVER completes
Object is considered not constructed
Reference assignment NEVER happens

📌 JVM rule:

An object exists only if constructor completes normally

That’s why:
obj == null
