16. Can pooled strings be garbage collected?
String s = new String("Java");
s = null;


Answer: Usually no.

Why:
String pool entries are strongly referenced by JVM.

new String("Java") creates a new String object in the heap (not in the pool).

"Java" (the literal) is in the String pool.

When you set s = null;, the heap object can be garbage collected (if there are no other
references).

But the pooled string ("Java") is still in the pool and cannot be garbage collected because the
JVM keeps a reference to it.
