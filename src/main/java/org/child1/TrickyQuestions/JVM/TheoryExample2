Why is java platform independent.

“Java is platform independent because it uses bytecode executed by JVM, which allows the same
code to run on different operating systems.”

“Java is platform independent because it is compiled into bytecode, which is executed by the JVM. Different platforms have different JVMs, but the bytecode remains the same.”

Break it simply:
Java code  →  Compiler  →  Bytecode  →  JVM  →  Machine code
