11. Why does Java distinguish between checked and unchecked exceptions?

Answer:

To enforce compile-time handling for recoverable conditions (checked) and allow flexibility for
programming errors (unchecked).

Checked exceptions are considered potentially recoverable,
not guaranteed to be recoverable.

Java forces you to acknowledge them (handle or declare) so that you consciously decide what to do.

What “recoverable” actually means (in Java terms)
When Java designers say recoverable, they mean:
There exists a reasonable scenario where the program might continue execution if the situation
is handled.

Examples:

File not found → ask for another file
Network timeout → retry
Database connection failed → reconnect

Not:

NullPointerException
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
StackOverflowError

Those usually indicate programming bugs, not environmental problems.

Why Java enforces checked exceptions

Consider this method:
void readFile() throws IOException

The compiler forces the caller to choose one:

Option 1: Handle it
try {
    readFile();
} catch (IOException e) {
    // retry, log, fallback, notify user
}

Option 2: Propagate it
void process() throws IOException {
    readFile();
}

Java is not saying “you must recover”.
It’s saying:
“You must decide whether to recover or delegate responsibility.”
That’s the key point.

Why unchecked exceptions are not forced

Unchecked exceptions represent:
Broken logic
Contract violations
Programming errors

Example:

list.get(10);

There is no meaningful recovery at runtime if the code is wrong.

Forcing try-catch here would:

Hide bugs
Encourage bad design
Add noise everywhere

So Java allows them to propagate freely.
