Scenario 2️⃣: Multiple exceptions in try-with-resources

try (A a = new A()) {
    throw new RuntimeException("try");
}


If close() throws exception too:

📌 TRY exception wins
Other becomes suppressed exception

This is the default behaviour of java that it will give preference to try's exception which also
happens to be the primary exception
