Why Java does not support pointers?

Best Interview Answer:
“Java does not support pointers to ensure security, memory safety, and avoid direct memory access.”

Key Reasons (VERY IMPORTANT):

Reason	                             Explanation

Security	                         Prevents unauthorized memory access
Safety	                             Avoids memory corruption
Simplicity	                         Easier for developers
No memory leaks	                     GC can work properly

Interview Line (Powerful):
“Pointers break encapsulation and can crash the JVM. Java avoids them to maintain robustness.”
