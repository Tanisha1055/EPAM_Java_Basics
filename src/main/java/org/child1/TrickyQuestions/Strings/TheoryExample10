Why can’t mutable objects be safely cached?

Caching means storing and reusing the same object instance to save memory and improve
performance. If an object is mutable (can be changed), then after it’s cached, any code
that gets a reference to it could change its value.
This means the next time someone retrieves the "same" object from the cache, it might
have a different value than expected, leading to bugs and unpredictable behavior.
