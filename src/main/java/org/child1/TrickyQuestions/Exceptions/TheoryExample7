1.Can I have try-with-resources without catch?

✅ Answer: Yes. try-with-resources can be used with only finally, or even alone. The resource will
always be closed automatically. Catch is optional.

Try-with-resources without catch — YES, LEGALLY
try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("a.txt"))) {
    System.out.println(br.readLine());
}

What happens?

Resource closed automatically

If exception occurs → propagated to caller

📌 You can have:

try
try + catch
try + finally
try + catch + finally

2.❓ Can a try block exist alone?

❌ NO
✅ YES only in try-with-resources

Try-with-resources
try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("a.txt")) {
    // code
}


✅ LEGAL

WHY this is allowed

Because resource management itself is a guaranteed behavior.

Behind the scenes, the compiler rewrites it into:

FileReader fr = new FileReader("a.txt");
try {
    // code
} finally {
    fr.close();
}

📌 So even without catch, there IS a finally-equivalent block
That’s why the grammar allows it.

👉 Key idea

Try-with-resources is NOT just try — it is try + implicit finally.
