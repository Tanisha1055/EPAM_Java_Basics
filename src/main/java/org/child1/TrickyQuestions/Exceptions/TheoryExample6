Q15. What is exception propagation?

Expected:
“Exception moves up the call stack until handled.”

Exception Propagation Explained:

When an exception occurs in a method and is not handled (no try-catch block for it in that method),
it is passed up (propagated) to the method that called it.
This process continues up the call stack—from method to method—until the exception is either
caught (handled) or reaches the top level (like the main method).
If the exception is never handled, the program will terminate and print a stack trace.
Example

void methodA() {
    methodB();
}

void methodB() {
    methodC();
}

void methodC() {
    int x = 1 / 0; // ArithmeticException occurs here
}
methodC() throws an exception.

If methodC() doesn’t handle it, the exception moves up to methodB().
If methodB() doesn’t handle it, it moves up to methodA().
If methodA() doesn’t handle it, it moves up to main().
If main() doesn’t handle it, the program crashes.

Summary Table
Where exception occurs	          Is it handled?	 What happens?
In method	                       Yes	             Handled there
In method	                       No	             Moves up to caller
Never handled	                   -	             Program terminates

In short:
Exception propagation means the exception “moves up the call stack” from method to method until
it is handled.
