❓ Can finally override exception?

✅ YES — dangerous


try {
    throw new RuntimeException();
} finally {
    return;
}

📌 Exception is LOST.

How can finally override (kill) an exception?

try {
    throw new RuntimeException("boom");
} finally {
    return;
}

What REALLY happens (step-by-step)

Exception is thrown in try
JVM says: “Before leaving method, run finally”
finally executes return
Return exits the method immediately

Exception object is discarded

📌 JVM rule:
A return, throw, or System.exit() in finally wins over everything
Same with:

finally {
    throw new RuntimeException("new");
}

👉 Original exception is lost, replaced by new one.

⚠️ This is why return in finally is considered a BAD PRACTICE
